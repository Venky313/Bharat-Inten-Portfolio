            <h1><b>CHATTU <br>VENKATALAKSHMI</b></h1>
            <h5><i>PEGA Developer</i></h5>
            <p class="pa">
                Passionate about leveraging technology to optimize business processes and drive efficiency. With a strong foundation
                in Pega platform, I've successfully completed the Pega certification, solidifying 
                my expertise in workflow automation, case management, and user-centric design. 
                Translating complex business challenges into streamlined solutions is my forte. 
                My journey to becoming Pega certified included hands-on projects where I designed
                and implemented robust workflow automation solutions that elevated operational efficiency and user experience.
                Beyond my Pega certification, I actively seek opportunities to enhance my skill set and contribute to the field's dynamic discourse.
                I believe in continuous learning as a key driver of professional growth.
